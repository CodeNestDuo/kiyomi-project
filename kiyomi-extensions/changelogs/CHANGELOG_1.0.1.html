<h3 id="-planned-upcoming-ideas-roadmap-">🔮 Planned / Upcoming (Ideas &amp; Roadmap)</h3>
<p>These are <strong>not guaranteed</strong>, but are actively being explored for future versions of Kiyomi:</p>
<h4 id="-backups-cloud-sync">💾 Backups &amp; Restore (In Progress)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Simple local backup system (currently in development):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create a backup file that includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>App settings and preferences.</li>
                    <li>Local database data (collections, watch progress, torrent metadata).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Manual export and import to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Move your setup to a new device.</li>
                    <li>Restore data after reinstalling the app.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Future cloud sync (exploration stage):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Optional cloud backups (e.g., Google Drive).</li>
            <li>Built on top of the local backup system.</li>
            <li>Fully opt-in and privacy-focused.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>


<h4 id="-external-list-integration-challenges">📝 External List Integration &amp; Challenges</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>TMDB Custom List Integration:</strong><ul>
<li>Explore the ability to <strong>import</strong> your TMDB custom lists and mirror them into Kiyomi collections.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Completion tracking:</strong><ul>
<li>Show how much of a list you’ve actually watched (e.g., “7/25 movies completed”).</li>
<li>Visual progress bars or simple percentage indicators.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Friendly “challenges”:</strong><ul>
<li>Optional mini-goals like:<ul>
<li>“Finish 10 movies from this list this month.”</li>
<li>“Complete Season 1 of this show in a week.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Progress indicators and simple stats—not hardcore gamification, just fun motivation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="-non-torrent-media-providers-experimental-thoughts-">🌐 Non-Torrent Media Providers (Experimental Thoughts)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Idea only (not committed yet):</strong><ul>
<li>Explore support for non-torrent provider types in the future, similar in spirit to apps like <strong>Aniyomi / Mangayomi</strong>:<ul>
<li>Direct streaming sources.</li>
<li>Other content APIs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If implemented, this would likely reuse the existing extension/provider system so everything stays modular.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="-desktop-pc-companion-longer-term-idea-">💻 Desktop / PC Companion (Longer-Term Idea)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Possible separate desktop app or companion:</strong><ul>
<li>We are exploring the development of a simple application for laptops/PCs. This could potentially be built using a streamlined language like <strong>Python</strong> (for ease of development and maintenance) or <strong>Kotlin Multiplatform</strong> for cross-platform compatibility.</li>
<li>The primary goal would be to act as a <strong>torrent powerhouse</strong>, capable of:<ul>
<li>Managing large-scale torrent downloads locally on your PC.</li>
<li>Sharing your media library with your Kiyomi mobile app.</li>
<li>Allowing your Kiyomi Android app to remotely control or stream files managed by the PC companion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Important Note:</strong> This is a very early, long-term idea. If pursued, it will require significant time and resources, which may temporarily take development focus away from the main mobile application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
